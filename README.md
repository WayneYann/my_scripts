## my_scripts

### Python scripts

* **activation_energy.py**: parses Gaussian output files to get energies of reactants, TS in gas-phase, solvents
* **checkEa.py**: goes through textfiles with activation energies, created from the `activation_energy.py` script, and finds negative ones
* **input.py**: the input script for autoTST
* **manualCalc.py**: generate TS geometry for one reaction based on folder you're in, using autoTST (so still semi automatic, not "manual", but on one reaction)
* **modifyReactionBarriers.py**: modifies existing Chemkin file for solvation kinetics. Creates a .csv file of changed reactions.
* **processCanteraOutput.py**: basically deprecated. puts Cantera outputs into Excel but based on specific output format that I no longer use
* **reactant_energies.py**: perform single point energy calculations in solvent on a set of gas phase reactant geometries - needs to be updated for SLURM
* **rmg_helper_functions.py**: a place for some helpful RMG functions that are reused often
* **SMD.py**: gathers barrier corrections from Gaussian jobs and puts them in the RMG database; creates a .csv file for doing some non-RMG machine learning
* **SMD_Abraham.py**: an alternative script which prints Abraham parameters to .csv file instead of atom properties
* **solvationGroups.py**: like `kineticsGroups.py` and `tsGroups.py`, generates the group values for solvation kinetics from training reactions in RMG-database
* **solvation_energies.py**: like `reactant_energies.py`, but for transition states
* **solvents.py**: deprecated, manual version of `reactant_energies.py`/`solvation_energies.py`
* **thermo_compare.py**: compares thermo from a text file to thermo generated by group additivity
* **V3_to_V4.py**: given two chemkin files and species dictionaries, will replace rates in the second mechanism with the rate in the first

### Shell scripts
* **ck2cti.sh**: runs the Cantera `ck2cti.py` from an RMG-generated Chemkin file without having to manually type the in/out file paths every time
* **submit.sh**: runs `input.py` on the West nodes on the Discovery cluster

### Jupyter notebooks
* **Classification.ipynb**: classifies silicon hydride AutoTST successes and failures to try to predict whether a reaction will work or not
